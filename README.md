# The Digital Builders 757 Platform

Welcome to the official repository of The Digital Builders 757 - a vibrant community initiative aimed at creating a dynamic platform where learning meets doing. We're building a space where every member of our Discord and Meetup community can contribute, collaborate, and grow together.

## About This Project

This project is the digital heart of The Digital Builders 757. It started as a simple web application featuring:
- User authentication
- A live chat room
- A to-do list (under construction)

As we open our doors to the open-source community, we're excited to see how this platform evolves with your contributions.
